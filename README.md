# ChatApp C#

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the development of a chat application using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. The application facilitates real-time communication between users, leveraging sockets for data transmission and a database for user authentication and message storage.

# Objective
The primary objective is to create a scalable and user-friendly chat application that ensures efficient data handling and a seamless user experience through the MVVM architecture.

# Workflow
**1.	Model (Data Layer):** Manages user information and messages.

**2.	ViewModel (Business Logic)**: Handles commands and interactions between the view and model.

**3.	View (User Interface)**: Displays data and captures user input.

# Tools
  **•	Visual Studio:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for development.
  
  **•	SQL Server:** Database management system for storing user data and messages.
  
  **•	NetMQ:** Library for socket communication.

# Language Used
**•	C#:** Primary programming language for developing the application.

**•	XAML:** Used for designing the user interface.

# Results
By implementing the MVVM architecture, the application maintains a clean separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability. The chat application successfully provides real-time communication, ensuring an efficient and intuitive user interface.
